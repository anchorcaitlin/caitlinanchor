% The tests below confirms the calculations of the time of flight, maximum
height and range of the projectile based on different options selected
by the user.

% Test 1. White box testing.
indexList = [4, 5, 6];
Expected output: No calculations will be computed since the user 
already knows the time of flight, maximum height and range of the projectile.

% Test 2. White box testing. 
indexList = [1, 2, 3];
initialVelocity = 70;
angleHorizontal = 40; 
initialHeight = 0;
Expected output: All valid values have been selected, so the program will
compute that:
time = 9.1827;
rangeProjectile = 492.4039;
maximumHeight = 103.2940;

% Test 3. White box testing. Testing when there have been invalid 
parameters entered by the user.
indexList = [1, 3, 5];
initialVelocity = 60;
initialHeight = -100;
rangeProjectile = 400;
Expected output: There will be no computations available for output to the 
user. The program will continue to prompt the user for another value for 
the initial height of the projectile that is positive.
