Collaborated with computer science students to create a game in which a player character combats enemies swarming towards them by shooting at them from a distance. Followed object oriented and pair programming paradigms, where I designed menu features, game functions and conducted unit testing. Developed using SFML and a text-based interface. Version control managed by GitHub.
