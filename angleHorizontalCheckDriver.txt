% Test 1.
% Test equivalence case of a boundary case.
% Expected output is 'false' since angleHorizontal does not lie between 
0 and 360 degrees. An angle of 0 degrees represents a horizontally launched
projectile. 
angleHorizontal = 0;
[angleHorizontal] = angleHorizontalCheck(angleHorizontal);

% Test 2.
% Test equivalence case of a positive number. 
% Expected output is 'true' since angleHorizontal lies between 0 and 
360 degrees. 
angleHorizontal = 300;
[angleHorizontal] = angleHorizontalCheck(angleHorizontal);

% Test 3.
% Test equivalence case of an extremely negative number.
% Expected output is 'false' since it lies below 0 degrees.  
angleHorizontal = -1900;
[angleHorizontal] = angleHorizontalCheck(angleHorizontal);
