% Test 1. 
% Test equivalence case of a boundary case.
% Expected output is 0. 
initialVelocity = 0;
angleHorizontal = 0;
[verticalInitial] = verticalInitial(initialVelocity, angleHorizontal);

% Test 2.
% Test equivalence case of a large positive number. Note, negative numbers
cannot be tested since the program will not compute any calculations with
negative values representing the 'initialVelocity' and 'angleHorizontal' 
since this is not practical in real-life contexts.
% Expected output is approximately 76.6.
