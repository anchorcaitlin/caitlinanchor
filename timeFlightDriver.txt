% The tests below tests that the correct time of flight has been identified 
by the function timeFlight. Since the user does not input the 
verticalInitial value, the computations will be done by hand and then 
compared to the results of the program. Random values representing the 
parameters will be entered by the user to determine the value of 
'verticalInitial', and then the value of the time of flight will be 
calculated by the program. 

% Test 1.
% Test equivalence case of a boundary case.
% There will be no expected output by the program. The only possible 
way that 'verticalInitial' will be zero is if the projectile is 
horizontally launched, which cannot occur in this program. Therefore, 
the user will be prompted to re-enter the initial velocity. 
verticalInitial = 0;
accelerationGravity = -9.8;
[time] = timeFlight (verticalInitial, accelerationGravity);

% Test 2. 
% Test equivalence case of a large positive number. Note, negative numbers
cannot be tested since the program will not compute any calculations with
negative values representing the 'initialVelocity' and 'angleHorizontal' 
since this is not practical in real-life contexts.
% Expected output is approximately 3.48 seconds. 
verticalInitial = 17.0;
accelerationGravity = -9.8;
[time] = timeFlight (verticalInitial, accelerationGravity);
