% The tests below test the results of the parameters entered by the user. 

% Test 1. White box testing.
indexList = [];
Expected output: There will be no prompts visible to the user since there
were no options selected. 

% Test 2: White box testing. Testing where there are no options to prompt
user for parameters.
indexList = [4, 5, 6]
Expected output: There will be no prompts visible since the 
user already knows the time of flight, maximum height and range of the 
projectile. This needs to be considered in the next scripts to provide
an output to the user to describe this.

% Test 3. Black box testing. 
indexList = [1, 2, 3]
Expected ouput: Since the values of the elements in indexList match 
ones of the options in the if-else statement, the program will prompt the 
user for the initial height, angle of the horizontal and the 
initial velocity.
