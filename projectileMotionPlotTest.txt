% The tests below describe the expected output for the graphs of the 
vertical displacement, velocity and acceleration against time of the 
projectile.

% Test 1. 
If the user selects:
indexList = [1, 2, 3];
initialVelocity = 60;
angleHorizontal = 30;
initialHeight = 0;

Expected output: Program will calcualted that time = 6.12 seconds, maximum 
height = 45.9 metres and the range = 318.1 metres. 

The graph representing the vertical displacement of projectile over time 
will take a parabolic shape, with a maximum height of 46.9 along the y-axis. 
The x-axis will have a constraint at approximately 6 seconds, representing 
the time of flight of the projectile.

The velocity of projectile over time will be the derivative of the graph 
of the vertical dispalcement of projectile over time. At the time the projectile
reaches its maximum height, the graph representing its velocity will have 
v = 0 and cut the x-axis. The x-axis will have a constraint at 
approximately 6 seconds, representing the time of the projectile.

The acceleration of the projectile over time will be a line equal to y = -9.8
since acceleration is a constant parameter in the program as the effects of 
air resistance is neglected. The x-axis will have a constraint at 
approximately 6 seconds, representing the time of the projectile.

% Test 2. 
If the user selects: 
indexList = [1];
Expected output: No graph since there are not enough parameters selected
by the user.

% Test 3. 
If the user selects:
indexList = [3, 4, 5, 6];
Expected output: No graph will be provided since the user already knows 
the time of flight, maximum height and range of the projectile.
