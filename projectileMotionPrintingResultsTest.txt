% The tests below confirms the expected results of the ways in which the 
values of the maximum height, range and time of flight of the projectile 
are printed out to the user.

% Test 1. 
indexList = [1];
Expected output: No calculations performed by the program since there 
are not enough known parameters selected. Therefore, there will be no message 
outputted regarding these calculations. 

% Test 2. 
indexList = [1, 2, 3];
Expected output: Calculations will be performed and outputted to the user 
since indexList = [1, 2, 3] allows calculations to be performed.
If the user selected:
initialVelocity = 60;
angleHorizontal = 20;
initialHeight = 1;
Expected output: 
The projectile reaches the ground at 4.18s
The projectile has a maximum height of 21.5m
The range of the projectile is 236.1m

% Test 3. 
indexList = [4, 5, 6];
Expected output: There will be no message displayed to the user since the 
user already knows the time of flight, range and maximum height of the 
projectile.
